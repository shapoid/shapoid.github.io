## bonus

The project get_next_line is straightforward and leaves very little room for bonuses, but I am sure that you have a lot of imagination. If you aced perfectly the mandatory part, then by all means complete this bonus part to go further. I repeat, no bonus will be taken into consideration if the mandatory part isn’t perfect.

Turn-in all 3 initial files with _bonus for this part.
• To succeed get_next_line with a single static variable.
• To be able to manage multiple file descriptor with your get_next_line. For example, if the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5 are accessible for reading, then you can call get_next_line once on 3, once on 4, once again on 3 then once on 5 etc. without losing the reading thread on each of the descriptors

## 1. read 함수

[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html)

### prototype

```jsx
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
```

ssize_t

signed size type. 해당 함수가 실패했을 때 -1 을 반환하기 위한 타입

[https://lacti.github.io/2011/01/08/different-between-size-t-ssize-t/](https://lacti.github.io/2011/01/08/different-between-size-t-ssize-t/)

### description

read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd  into the buffer starting at buf.

On files that support seeking, the read operation commences at the file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes read.  If the file offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes are read, and read() returns zero.

If count is zero, read() may detect the errors described below. In the absence of any errors, or if read() does not check for errors, a read() with a count of 0 returns zero and has no other effects.

According to POSIX.1, if count is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the result is implementation-defined; see NOTES for the upper limit on Linux.

### return value

## 2. 정적 변수

## intro

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for
us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions
in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code.

• The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
• You have to recode the libc’s printf function
• It must not do the buffer management like the real printf
• It will manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
• It will manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’ and minimum field
width with all conversions
• It will be compared with the real printf
• You must use the command ar to create your library, using the command libtool
is forbidden.

## bonus

• If the Mandatory part is not perfect don’t even think about bonuses
• You don’t need to do all the bonuses
• Manage one or more of the following conversions: nfge
• Manage one or more of the following flags: l ll h hh
• Manage all the following flags: ’# +’ (yes, one of them is a space)
